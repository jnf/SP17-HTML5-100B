# Certificate in HTML5, CSS3 & Responsive Design for Web Development

This website contains information, lectures, and code sample for use in **HTML5 & CSS3 Foundations (100)**, Spring 2017.

Instructor: [Jeremy Flores](mailto:jnf13@uw.edu)

## Syllabus
Students gain a deep understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) while getting up-to-date on the latest HTML5 and CSS3 features and techniques. Write concise, reusable front end code from scratch. Learn strategies for building dynamic layouts, build your own designs, and implement provided mockups. Leverage open source, modern tools to expand your abilities and collaborate with colleagues. 

### Topics include
- Proper use of HTML5, including new semantic elements
- Custom styling including web fonts
- Introduction to client server architecture
- Principles of effective user experience
- Media playback with new HTML5 media elements
- Introduction to Bootstrap

### Course Learning Objectives
- Strong understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals
- Ability to write semantic, valid, and reusable HTML and CSS
- Ability to translate design mockups into working code
- Understanding of web accessibility
- Functional understanding of modern version control

### Course Format
Each week, students will be watch pre-recorded lectures covering _new_ material. All classes happen online, using some combination of _Adobe Connect_ and _Panopto_. Detailed information about these programs is available on the UW Canvas website for the course.

As much as possible, classes will be in the style of a workshop: a technique or concept will be demonstrated, and then you will have time to practice it. Weekly assignments will build upon concepts taught in class. I believe the best way to learn to code is to do it, and my role is to facilitate your explorations.

### Policies and Core Values
The classroom is a place of respect and equity. All students' learning needs are important. All students' ideas and points of view are valuable. I expect students to behave professionally at all times and to never engage in bullying or harassment. The core values of the classroom are curiosity, kindness, and empathy.

#### Attendance
_Class attendance is critical. Students will not pass if they miss more than two class meetings._

Attendance at each class is expected. Please let me know via email if you will need to miss a class. You are still responsible for any homework assigned during a class you do not attend. 

#### Homework
Homework assignments are due by _10am_. Late submissions will be penalized by **20%**. All assignments must be turned in by **Monday, 4/11/17** for credit toward the course. Failure to turn in an assignment will prevent you from passing the course.

This is a collaborative learning environment, and I encourage students to work together. You will also be researching problems and viewing other peoples' code online, as this is how web developers solve problems in the real world. However, copying someone else's code wholesale and submitting it as your own is unacceptable.
